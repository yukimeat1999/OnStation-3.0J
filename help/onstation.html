<P><h2><font color="#ff0000">1.0 - Why This is Not a Standard Help File</font></h2></p></A>
<P>This is not a standard context sensitive help file.  I don't have time for that. If you think one is necessary, please
write one and send it to me.  I have decide to adopt HTML for my help files.  This
allows me to provide URLs to updates and bug lists.  It also takes a lot less time to code
then all the Microsoft .HLP file nonsense.</p>



<P>This manual is intended to be far more useful then
a help file. I have explained all of the key concepts in <b>On Station</b>.
The only thing missing is stupid explanations of how to resize
a window or how the File Save Dialog works. I'm too busy and nobody
reads that crap anyway.  So enjoy the help.  I hope it answers all your questions!</p>





<A NAME="overview">
<P><h2><font color="#ff0000">2.0 - Overview of <b>On Station</font></h2></p></b></A>


<P>I assume that if you are reading up on <b>On Station</b>,
you probably already know how a cave is mapped and what is involved
in dealing with the data. If you do not, then there are other
sources on the Web which can be of great assistance in these areas.
I will assume a knowledgeable reader and educate on the software
rather the survey techniques.</p>

<P><b>On Station</b> helps you manage the data which is produced
when you map caves. The basic working unit in <b>On Station</b> is the
Survey. Surveys contain Shots, Comments, and background information
such as who was involved and when the survey was done.</p>

<P>Most people will use <b>On Station</b> to plot Surveys in
three dimensions. <b>On Station</b> has excellent support for this.</p>
<ul>

<LI> A simple yet powerful interface lets you rotate,
zoom, and move the system so that you can examine it from various
angles.</li>

<LI> Loop closure logic allows you to perform error averaging to get rid of the gaps in surveys which double back on themselves.</li><br><br>

<LI> Sophisticated coloring schemes allow you to color surveys or interesting features for maximum effect or visibility.</li><br><br>

<LI> Advanced OpenGL support uses Up/Down/Left/Right data to give you an indication of passage dimensions.</li><br><br></p>
</UL>
<br>



<P><b>On Station</b> is intended to allow you to manage far
more then just one cave, however. An intuitive hierarchical system
of organization lets you manage data for large projects. <b>On Station</b>
has been used extensively in the field in Mexico in the Cerro
Blanco project. We have over 50km in several system and many smaller
caves. Entrances are tied together by surface surveys or GPS locations.

<b>On Station</b> has been used in the field on this project and the
lessons have been used to beef up <b>On Station</b>'s support for large
projects.</p>


<ul>


<LI> You can use <font size=-1>GPS</font> data or surface surveys to set
up systems consisting of many caves in the same area.</li><br><br>


<LI> You can enter surface topography so that you
can see underground features in relation to the surface.</li><br><br>


<LI> You can easily get statistics or views of small subsets of a larger system.</li><br><br>


<LI> You can perform queries on you data. For example, you could color
all areas that contain &quot;Lead <font size=-1>AND NOT</font> Crawling&quot;
in red.</li><br><br></p>


</ul>
<br>

I feel that I have succeeded in my goal of making the friendliest and easiest to learn
cave software available, without compromising on power or features.  On Station can
handle projects of any size and complexity.  And the simple intuitive interface
will allow you to spend more time working with your data, and less time fighting with
your tools.

<A NAME="layout">
<h2><font color="#ff0000">3.0 - Screen Layout</font></h2>
<p><b>On Station</b> has a pretty easy screen layout. On the
left side of your main window is an displaying all of the data in your system.
The sections below explain what the controls in this area do.
<center><a href="img00001.gif"><IMG SRC="img00001.gif" alt="screen shot of data tree"></a></p>
Boy, does that ever make it easy to organize data!</center>


</tr></table></p>




<A NAME="layoutcolorschemes">


<br><BR>

<P><h3><font color="#ff0000">3.1 - Color Schemes</font></h3></p></A>


<P>The first control is a Combo Box with a list of the color
schemes. Simply type in a new name if you don't like the existing
ones. There are eight named color schemes and two special ones. Each
of the name color schemes tracks an independent set of colors for
each survey. You can set the color of a survey simply by selecting
it and pressing a color. The survey picture shows which color
was selected. If you select a folder, all surveys in that folder
will be set to the selected color.</p>

<center><a href="img00002.gif"><IMG SRC="img00002.gif" alt="color schemes selection window"></a></p>
Changing colors is simple!</center></p>

<P>In the two special color schemes, surveys are colored
based on Age (the date that the survey was done), or Depth. You
can configure which colors are associated with which ages or depths
in the Configure option under the Colors menu. Alternatively,
you can right click anywhere in the color area or press the configure
button.</p>


<center><P><a href="img00003.gif"><IMG SRC="img00003.gif" alt="configure color schemes window"></a></p>
Configuring age and depth colors</center>

<P>Two colors have a special meaning. <b>Hide</b> hides a survey
so that it is not shown. The survey is still used in calculations,
so branches off that survey are still drawn. <b>Disable</b> temporarily
removes a survey from all calculations. Anything that needs to
traverse that survey to be shown is not drawn. Disabling the middle
section in a linear cave would show only half the cave. Hiding
it would show the full cave with the middle section not drawn. Disable
is often used when you have loop closure errors and you want to
see how various loops effect the result.</p>




<A NAME="layoutdatatree">
<br>
<br>

<P><h3><font color="#ff0000">3.2 - Data Tree</font></h3></p></A>


<P>Below the color area is the survey data tree.
It contains all of the data in your system. First is
a list of all the surveys. They are stored in hierarchical folders
much like files in a directory tree. Any action done to a folder
is done to all surveys contained in it.</p>


<P>Folders and surveys can be:</p>
<ul>
<p><LI> Reordered by dragging and dropping them. </li>

<LI> Renamed by clicking on the name twice, slowly. </li>

<LI> Deleted by pressing Del or selecting Delete from the edit menu. </li>

<LI> Added by selecting Survey or Folder from the Insert menu. </li>

<LI> Cut/Copied, and pasted.</li>

<LI> Edited by double clicking on them or selecting Edit under the Edit menu. </li>

<LI> Summarized by clicking Survey Info in the edit menu. This will show you how many shots a folder contains and
how long those shots are.</li></p>


</UL>


<P>You can also right click on the folder portion to get a menu of all the available options.</p>


<A NAME="layoutfixedpoints">
<P><B><h3><font color="#ff0000">3.3 - Fixed Points</font></h3></B></A>

<P>Below the folders is a list of Fixed Points. Fixed
points are stations which are at a known location. This location
could be a GPS reading, or simply some numbers that you have assigned
to it. The system will ensure that the named station is drawn
at the specified location on the map. Fixed points are extremely
useful if you have multiple entrances to a system, or when you
have surface surveys that tie into well known locations.</p>

<P><center><a href="img00004.gif"><IMG SRC="img00004.gif" alt="fixed points"></a></p>
Large system leading away from a fixed point at the entrance</center>

<br>
<p>Fixed points are drawn as pins on the main survey so that you can easily see where they are. You can turn this off
under the drawing menu if it is annoying.</p>

<P>Fixed points require a Station Name and coordinates.
If the station name you entered is invalid, the fixed point is
shown in the fixed point list with an ? through it to indicate
a problem. You will also get a dialog box warning you that the
fixed point is not associated with any station.</p>

<center><P><a href="img00005.gif"><IMG SRC="img00005.gif" alt="Station Name error"></a></p>

Edit under the Edit menu. </li>
<LI> Deleted by pressing Del or by selecting Delete from the Edit menu. </li>
<LI> Added from the Insert Menu.</li></p>

</UL>


<P> The final item in the tree is the surface. The surface can be:</p>

<A NAME="caveview">
<P><h2><font color="#ff0000">4.0 - Cave View Area </h2></font></p>


<P>Next to the data view area is the cave view area.
It is a large black window which should be displaying you cave
if you have a file open. The view area can be made bigger by pressing
Ctrl+F or by hitting the full screen button. If you do this, all
menus, toolbars, and so forth will be temporarily removed so that
the view may occupy the whole screen. Pressing <b>Escape</b> or the <b>End
Full Screen</b> button ends this mode.</p>

<P>The cave consists of the basic cave data, plus any


optional items which have been selected, and is drawn in the colors


described by the current color scheme. It is shown at the current


magnification, panning, and viewing angle. Optional items are

<A NAME="caveviewscale">

<br>
<br>
<P><h3><pre><font color="#ff0000">4.1 - Setting the Scale </pre></font></h3></p></B></A>


<P>
Scale is measure in Meters/CM or Feet per Inch. It
is roughly correct when on-screen, and very accurate when printed.
The status bar and the ruler on the left hand side of the Cave
View Area both show the current scale.</p>




<P>You can set the scale in a number of different ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><LI> Press the Zoom In/Zoom Out buttons on the main toolbar. </li>
<LI> Right Click on the ruler and select a scale. </li>
<LI> Right Click on the drawing area. </li>
<LI> Hold down the shift key and drag the mouse left or right to zoom in real-time. </li>
<LI> Select Set Exact View from the Edit menu and enter the scale directly. </li></p>

<A NAME="caveviewsetviewangle">
<br>
<P><h3><font color="#ff0000">4.2 - Setting the Viewing Angle</font></h3></p></A>


<P>The viewing angle is expressed as a rotation and
a tilt. The system starts of with north going up the screen (rotation=0).
It is then rotated by the rotation (90 degrees would leave the
system with East (going up the screen). Finally, it is tilted forwards
or back. A 90 degree tilt shows the system side on. East would
now be in the back and West in the front. A -90 degree tilt shows
the same system upside down. East would be in the front and West
in the back.</p>


<P>The current view angles are shown in the status bar
and are also reflected in the On-Screen compass. You can set the view angle in a number of different
ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right click on the drawing area.</li>
<li>Right click on the compass.</li>
<li>Drag the needle or the tilt indicator on the compass.</li>
<li>Select Set Exact View from the Edit menu and enter
the tilt and rotation directly.</li>
<li>Hold down the right arrow key and drag up and down
to tilt/left and right to rotate. If you press the animate button
or select the animate menu option, the system will continue to
turn until you click on the drawing area or press the button again.</li></p>

the middle of the screen. Any rotations and so forth occur around
this point.</p>

<br>

<br>

<P><h3><font color="#ff0000">4.4 - Bookmarks </font></h3></p></A>


<P>A cave system can be extremely large and spread out.
Bookmarks allow you to save key views of a large system. At any
time you can simply select Edit, Bookmark to go to an existing
bookmark or set a new one for the current view. Bookmarks are
saved with your data. Bookmarks remember the Scale, Center, and
Rotation of the system but do not track colors or optional items
which were turned on and off.</p>

<A NAME="surfdata">
<P><h2><font color="#ff0000">5.0 - Surface Data Explained</font></h2></p></A>


<P>
<b>On Station</b> allows you to define the surface which
exists over your system. You can turn the display of this surface
on and off in the Drawing menu.</p>




<P>
Surface data is specified by providing altitudes
at various locations on a grid. A grid is defined in terms of
the lower left corner and a size. The lower left corner could
be either UTM coordinates or some arbitrary coordinate system.
</p>



<P>
Typically, the way you would enter surface data is
to use a photocopier to blow up a map of your caving area and
then draw a grid onto it. You then enter the altitudes at the
various grid points into your system. It sucks, it takes a long
time, but it sure looks good when you are done. Typically a grid
size of 100m is a reasonable scale.</p>




<P>
Alternately, you can buy Surface elevation data from
various sources. You may even be able to get it for free if you
live in the right country. In this case, you can use these number
and save yourself a lot of work. If you get some of these data
files please let me know so I can add support for reading them
directly.</p>


<P>
To edit surface data, double click on the surface
icon on the tree control on the left side of the main display
window. The surface data editor has two tabs. One tab lets you
set the size of the surface, the reference coordinates, and the
size of each grid entry. The other tab lets you enter the actual
surface data values.</p>




<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="img00010.gif" alt="edit surface data window">
<br>
Entering surface data: What fun!</p>
</center>




<P>
Surfaces can have an declination. If you specify
a declination, then the grid squares will run in the declination
direction rather the directly N/S. Some topographical maps do
not run grid lines directly North/South, so this function can
be a life saver. The declination that you will use is often called
the &quot;Grid North&quot; on topographical maps.</p>


<P>
By default the cave system is drawn centered on the
surface. To change this simply add a fixed point to tie an entrance
into a known location on the surface.</p>


<A NAME="import">
<P><h2><font color="#ff0000">6.0 - Exchanging Data With Other Programs</font></h2></p></A>


<P>
<b>On Station 3.0</b> supports Cave Data Interchange files.
These files follow a format that Larry Fish and myself have worked
on. It is intended to be easy to work with yet powerful enough
to store anything that you may need. Hopefully all of the major
authors of caving software will support this standard so that
you can read <b>On Station</b> files in other programs and Vice Versa.
</p>




<P>
Many people, however, have data from programs such
as SMAPS which are obsolete and unsupported. To assist with this I have provided a file
import utility called the Rosetta Stal.  You can download this from the
main On Station home page.</p>
To run the Rosetta Stal from On Station, select Import from the file menu.  The Rosetta
Stal does file conversions, which means that your original data is not touched.  It simply
reads the orginal file and writes a CDI file.  You can then load the CDI file
into On Station.
<P>
If you have any problems with this process, or run
into valid files that do not work, please email me with a
description of the problem and a copy of the file so that the
import program can be updated.</p>


<A NAME="printing">
<h2><font color="#ff0000">7.0 - Printing</font></h2></p></A>


<P>
<b>On Station</b> supports both color and monochrome printers.


<b>On Station</b> will print using you current view settings. Essentially,


you set you view to the angle, scale, and coloring which you would


like, and then you print it. What you see is what you get, except


that it will be split up over multiple pages and include rulers,


a North Arrow, a Scale bar, and other items that you ask for.
</p>




<P>
You can control all of the optional items which are
displayed by selecting Configure Page in the File menu.</p>




<P><b>On Station</b> 3.0 currently is only able to produce
line plots. This is a known problem and I am planning to fix this
eventually. The problem is due to a bug in the Microsoft
implementation of OpenGL.</p>




<br><br><br>


<A NAME="loop">
<h2><font color="#ff0000">8.0 - Closing Loops (Error Correction)</font></h2>


<P>
Loop closure closes the loops caused by survey errors
and produces a highly accurate model of the resulting cave. You
can turn loop closure on and off under the Drawing menu. Loop
closure data is recalculated whenever data for a view changes.
It can be quite a lengthy calculation, so I advise turning it
off whenever you are preparing to do editing. One you have closed
a system, the closed data will be remembered until you make changes
to the data.</p>




<P>
<b>On Station</b>'s loop closure makes use of standard instrument
errors. These are provided in the Instruments tab of the survey
edit dialog. These settings allow you to specify what the accuracy
of various instruments in a survey is. For instance, I have done
a lot of surveying where we were in large, dry passages and took
front and back readings. These surveys will have a high degree
of accuracy (say +-0.5 degrees on the compass).</p>




<P>
In the same system, there have been surveys where
we were clinging to the walls of a river trying to read instruments
in the spray. Obviously, these surveys are not as accurate. In
this case, compass readings may be good to +-5 degrees.</p>


<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="img00011.gif" alt="edit survey leg -instruments window">
Entering instrument errors
</center>
</p>



<P>Standard errors identify the range of one standard
deviation from the reading. If you don't understand what this
means, I am unlikely to be able to explain it. Suffice it to say
that this is a measurement that would make a statistician very
happy. </p>


<P>
Practically speaking, surveys which high errors will
be adjusted much more then surveys with low errors. This means
that you could survey main branches with highly accurate methods
and given them a low error rate and then survey the side branches
more quickly. <b>On Station</b> will then use the main branches as the
structure for your system and pull the side branches into shape
to match them.</p>

<A NAME="SEARCH">
<h2><font color="#ff0000">9.0 Queries and Searches</font></h2></p>


<P>
Large surveys can contain a lot of information. In
traditional cave software systems, most of this information vanishes
when you enter it into the computer. Sure, you can enter comments
into a survey, but who really sees that information and how do
you use it?</p>




<P>
<b>On Station</b> changes that by providing sophisticated
search features. Searches are done on a survey level or on a shot
level.</p>




<A NAME="surveysearches">
<P><h3><font color="#ff0000">9.1 - Survey Level Searches</font></h2></p></A>




<P>
Survey level searches search for surveys which match
particular characteristics. For example, if you want to find all
of the surveys you were part of, you can do that. If you want
to find all of the surveys that you were part of that contained
MUD in the description, you can do that too (maybe to avoid those spots!).</p>



<P>
You set up your query in the Query, Surveys menu.
A form provides you with a set of empty fields into which you
can enter search terms. These fields correspond more or less to
the fields you enter when you set up a survey. In each field you
can enter optional search terms. These terms follow standard wording
like you would use on an Internet search engine. Key words supported
are NOT, AND, OR, (,),&quot;&quot;. Examples of valid search strings
 would be:</p>


<ul>

<P>
&quot;Blowing Lead&quot; AND NOT wet.</p>


<P>
Blowing OR (&quot;Good Lead&quot; AND NOT (Crawling OR Nasty)</p>
</ul>



<center><P>
<IMG SRC="img00012.gif" alt="query surveys - search conditions"></p>
Only On Station can do this!</center>

<P>
When you press the search button, the tree view on
the left hand side of the screen is updated to show only the surveys
which match your search. The background of the dialog changes
to a question mark pattern to show that you are seeing a query
specific view. A text description of the survey is on the bottom
of the view to let you know what you are seeing.</p>

It will stay in this view until you press Escape
or select End Search from the Query menu. The nice thing about
this is that you can do all of the things you would normally do
to the tree view, except that you are now working with only the
matching surveys. So you could select the root and color all of
the surveys which match your search terms red. Or you could get
information and find out how many shots there are and how long

<P>
Station Comment Searches take a different approach.
What they do is look for comments which match your search terms.
You can choose to see a list of these stations, or you can choose
to color shots linked to these stations on the survey.</p>


<center>

<P><IMG SRC="img00014.gif" alt="search through comments window"></p>
Searching through survey comments is easy too!</center>


<P>
When you color the shots on the survey, you can choose
to color the from shot, the to shot, or both. When you set the
coloring, the system will also place a small ? next to each station
that matches the query. Double clicking on the question mark will
show you which station it is. To turn off Station Comment Searches
press the ESC key or select End Query from the Query menu.</p>

This information is sensitive to queries. If you
wanted to find out how much of a system you had surveyed, you
could set up a query to show you all the surveys you were involved
with and then get back the information the same way as described
above.</p>


<P>You can also get information about the current view.
View information is sensitive to loop closures, fixed points on
the surface, and so forth.</p>


View information is available under
Query, Current View information. To get view information on only
a portion of the system use the disable feature in the colors
to turn off those sections of the system you are not interested
in.</p>

You can start a new survey by selecting Insert, Survey
or by pressing the Insert Survey button on the tool bar. When
you do so, you are brought into the Survey Edit Dialog. Do not
be afraid. The dialog contains a lot of information but you won't
need to enter much of it if you don't want to.</p>

The survey editor is powerful and simple to use.
</center>



<P>
The first screen lets you set summary information
for the survey. This includes a name, default units, and some
information about the survey type. You must also specify a date
since <b>On Station</b> has a number of features which use the date to
provide you with neat information.</p>

When you have provided this information, you should
select the Entries Tab to start entering data.</p>

The S/W/L fields indicate Surface, Wall, Length.
Enter an X, or a Y or any other character in these fields to activate
them. When activated, the indicate Surface Surveys, Wall Shots,
and Length Exclusion. Surface surveys are surveys outside of the
cave (between entrance for example). Wall shots are shots which
are inside the cave but which are used to define the walls rather
then to follow a passage. Length exclusion means that the shot
should not be included in any length calculations.</p>

<h2><font color="#ff0000">12.0 - Tips from the experts</font></h2></p>
Although On Station is very easy to use, there are a lot of hints and tips that can
make your life much easier.  Here are some of the more useful ones:
<ul>
<li>When surveying a cave, try to keep your station names unique.  If every survey numbers the Stations 1,2,3,4...
then you will have to rename them in On Station, and you will also have a heck of time figuring out where you are
when you connect to a station numbered 7.  I like to use a hear and a letter, for example
97A1, 97A2, 97A3.</li>
<li>In the main 3d view, you can double click on station names to get details about that station.</li>
<li>Put copious comments into the comment fields.  That way you can search them later to find leads and other information.</li>
<li>Color schemes and bookmarks let you save important views easily so you don't have to keep trying to find them again.</li>
<li>Make use of folders for large systems to keep your data organized.</li>
<li>Use fixed points to put all the caves in an area on the same map, even without surface surveys.  You can turn off the caves you don't want to see by using the
disabled color.</li>
</ul>
